# Open Solid
Open Solid - Blender 3D add-on that allows opening all .blend files with the "Solid" viewport mode, even if they were saved with the "Material Preview" viewport mode.

Add-on functionality
-
When opening a .blend file that was saved with the "Material Preview" viewport mode turned on, Blender immediately starts loading textures and compiling shaders to display them in the viewport. If the scene is large and complex, with heavy textures, and the computer is not very powerful, this process can take a significant amount of time, slowing down and even pausing work.

The “Open Solid” addon, works in the background and automatically switches the viewport to the “Solid” mode when opening new files, no matter in what mode they were saved, which removes delays caused by loading textures and materials.

After opening the file, you can immediately start working.
